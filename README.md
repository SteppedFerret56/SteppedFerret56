## Hi there

I'm Flynn, an aspiring programmer who is planning on studying in computing and 
working on my programming skills. I wish to work on many exciting and innovative projects 
throughout my time as a programmer. In my free time I enjoy working on my home lab (I 
somehow manage to break more things than i actually fix) and playing computer games.
