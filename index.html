                weather radar, aircraft radar, airport weather information, and flight planning. While I still have not implemented
                a majority of these features my end goal is to have all of them.</h3>

        <h2 class="myStoryTitle">My Story</h2>
        <h3 class="myStoryText">I was born at the end of 2009 and have since attended 6 schools and am currently attending my 7th one. When I was younger I always struggled to fit in
        and never really was a large fan of school. I was also in trouble ever other day for chatting with my friends on class. This all changed in 4th grade when my teacher there put
        me in my place. This was the turning point for me, as I suddenly had a newfound interest in Maths and school. This continued through to 7th grade, I was always in maths extension
        classes and was generally the most sensible kid in class. Being more self-aware and conscious about whom I befriended I did not have many friends. This was also the year when I
        got infected with long covid (also known as Post covid syndrome). This illness lasted me a little less than two years and resulted in me hardly going outside due to lack of energy,
        and also performing badly in school because of my migraines and brain fog. However, I stayed strong and pushed myself to learn HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I started work on a website
        for an imaginative country in a Minecraft server that I was active on. See it in the "Projects" section further down.</h3>
