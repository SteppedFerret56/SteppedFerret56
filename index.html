                weather radar, aircraft radar, airport weather information, and flight planning. While I still have not implemented
                a majority of these features my end goal is to have all of them.</h3>

        <h3 class="myStoryText">In fourth grade, a teacherâ€™s mentorship sparked a strong interest in mathematics, leading to my active
            involvement in advanced math classes. My focus on academics was consistent, even with a select group of friends. During
            seventh grade, I encountered the challenge of long COVID, which affected me for nearly two years, influencing my academic
            performance. Amidst this, I pursued web development, learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and created a website for a Minecraft
            server community project.</h3>
